# pyrho 

I am also working on restructuring the pyrho pipeline and making efficient scripts that handle the outputs. 
While the pipeline is still TO DO the make_windows process has been sped up immensely and can be applied to most inputs (especially with different window sizes). 
I need to explain it in more detail and make the script agnostic to input name (ex. I kinda need them named ch_m146_S-S-# for it to work).
